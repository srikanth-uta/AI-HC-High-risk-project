    "\n",
    "You now have a complete QLoRA fine-tuning pipeline set up for your healthcare LLM project:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Dependencies Installed ✅**\n",
    "- `bitsandbytes` for 4-bit quantization\n",
    "- `peft` for LoRA adapters  \n",
    "- `trl` for supervised fine-tuning\n",
    "- `datasets` for data handling\n",
    "- `accelerate` for training optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Data Pipeline Ready ✅** \n",
    "- Loads your 9,368 generated Q&A examples\n",
    "- Formats data for Llama3 instruction tuning\n",
    "- Creates train/validation HuggingFace datasets\n",
    "- Uses proper chat formatting with special tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. QLoRA Configuration ✅**\n",
    "- **4-bit quantization**: Reduces memory usage by ~75%\n",
    "- **LoRA adapters**: Only trains ~0.2% of parameters\n",
    "- **Optimized settings**: Rank=16, Alpha=32, target modules configured\n",
    "- **Memory efficient**: Gradient checkpointing, FP16 training\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Training Setup ✅**\n",
    "- **Smart batching**: Batch size=1, gradient accumulation=4  \n",
    "- **Learning schedule**: Cosine LR decay with warmup\n",
    "- **Monitoring**: Evaluation every 50 steps, saves best model\n",
    "- **Hardware optimized**: Works on single GPU with limited VRAM\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Evaluation & Saving ✅**\n",
    "- Model evaluation on validation set\n",
    "- Saves fine-tuned adapters and tokenizer\n",
    "- Includes training configuration and metadata\n",
    "- Testing function to validate fine-tuned model\n",
    "\n",
    "## **🚀 Next Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Run the training cells** in sequence (they're ready to execute)\n",
    "2. **Start training** by uncommenting the training line\n",
    "3. **Monitor progress** - training will take 2-4 hours depending on hardware\n",
    "4. **Evaluate and save** the model when complete\n",
    "5. **Test** the fine-tuned model with medical questions\n",
    "\n",
    "## **💡 Training Tips:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Memory**: If you get OOM errors, reduce batch size or use `load_in_8bit=True`\n",
    "- **Time**: Training ~9K examples will take 2-4 hours on typical GPU\n",
    "- **Monitoring**: Watch for decreasing validation loss\n",
    "- **Quality**: Fine-tuned model should give more targeted healthcare advice\n",
